tools and new thinking from the software industry.
Concurrency has long been touted as the "next big thing" and "the
way of the future," but for the past 30 years, mainstream software
development has been able to ignore it. Our parallel future has
finally arrived: new machines will be parallel machines, and this
will require major changes in the way we develop software. The
introductory article in this issue ("The Future of Microprocessors"
by Kunle Olukotun and Lance Hammond) describes the hardware
imperatives behind this shift in computer architecture from
uniprocessors to multicore processors, also known as CMPs (chip
multiprocessors). (For related analysis, see "The Free Lunch Is
Over: A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software.")},
